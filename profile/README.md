## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **Decent Stuff**! We’re a collaborative organization where open source meets creative minds. Our current main focus is [Decent Cloud](https://github.com/decent-stuff/decent-cloud), a project to simplify the use of cloud resources — whether those resources come from AWS, from your neighbor’s GPU, or anything else in between. Check it out to see how we’re shaping the future of decentralized hosting, complete with a community-driven token system and no vendor lock-in.

We plan to expand our ecosystem over time, adding more projects to the Decent Stuff organization. Stay tuned!

### 🙋‍♀️ What We’re About
We’re passionate about building open source solutions that empower individuals and organizations, giving people the freedom to choose and the tools to succeed. We believe in:
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure, no corporate lock-in.  
- **Simplicity**: One interface for multiple cloud providers and peer-based resources.  
- **Community Governance**: Decisions driven by contributors and users, not by VCs.  

Currently, our big project is **Decent Cloud**, which is production-ready but under active development. We welcome your feedback and ideas!
